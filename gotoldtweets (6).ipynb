    "What I'm trying to do at this point is, combine this code in the cell directly below with the cell directly below that one (\"Tweet getter\" cell). More specifically: I want to keep the code that I have, but use the information from the \"tweet getter\" cell -- the \"dates\", and time.sleep() information -- in the code right below. The problem is that, as the code was earlier on in thie notebook, getoldtweets was only returning tweets from the last week of the year, and if I implement the dates list and keep updating it and loop my code through those dates, it'll create a more even dispersion of tweets across my 4-year timeframe. For now, I think I'll swap out dates in the 'dates' list for each year (so, run it for 2016 with 3 date markers set at even intervals apart, wait for that to run, then swap out the dates for 2017, and so on. Unless there's a more efficient way to go about it). I do want to have each year in a separate csv since I'll want to do both within and across year analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also need to add the time.sleep() feature so my IP address doesn't get blocked. But, I'm just not sure how to fit those parts into my code. I tried creating a double-nested for loop as a start with \"for date in dates' before \"for keyword in keywords\". I still want everything output in a dataframe/exported as csv. For now, planning to do one iteration per year (one each for 2016-2020), so I'd have separate csv's for each year and evenly dispersed tweets for each year."
